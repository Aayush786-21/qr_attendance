introduction - i want to showcase my python skills and make a qr_attendance system which will create a admin login page. students and teachers can add their qr code through the camera, this system will create a time stamp and show case if you are late to the school or college.
this is my first project so i am using the help of chatgpt also.
objectives - to make a system and deploy it into clouds, make use docker ansible kubernetes and manymore to introduce myself in the field of devops. 
so in the "added new code commit" i have done the general qr generation. and stored it in attendance.db
in the "phase 2" i am trying to build a login page of different personnel "students", "teachers" and "admin"
phase 3 i am trying to build login page for only admin.. 
phase 4 just more trying and getting frustrated right now but i made docker file and tried to deploy this system through docker.. which went well.
